# üîç subs

<img src = preview.png alt="subs preview" width = "500dp">

A utility to grab valid domains and subdomains from files, split them if they're fused, resolve them and more - straight from the command-line! 
This is a command-line utility written in Golang as a proof-of-concept for the [textsubs package](https://github.com/0x4f53/textsubs).

Note: This tool only extracts subs from text. It does not extract URLs (there are several methods to do that, such as grep and regular
expressions)

Features:
- Splits fused strings (`google.comapple.comblog.0x4f.in` magically becomes `google.com` `apple.com` `blog.0x4f.in`)
- Resolves subdomains and domains concurrently in seconds
- Multiple kinds of output, including domain, subdomain or both as JSON!


## ‚öôÔ∏è Building

To build this on your machine, you need to have Golang installed.
If you do, simply make build.sh executable and run it like so

```bash
‚ùØ chmod +x build.sh
‚ùØ ./build.sh
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
##### Linux and macOS

Simply run the `./install.sh` script (don't 
have the time to put this on package managers)

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

And to uninstall

```bash
chmod +x uninstall.sh
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

You can also find the binaries in [`.build/binaries`](.build/binaries/) if you want to directly run them
without installation

### üñäÔ∏è Usage
```bash
subs [input_file] [flags]
```

#### Flags

  - `-h`, `--help`      Help
 
  - `-d`, `--domains`   Get domains only

  - `-r`, `--resolve`   Only get items that resolve (using local DNS settings)

  - `-p`, `--pair`   Pair as a JSON string `{"subdomain":"www.example.com", "domain": "example.com"}`
  
  - `-k`, `--keepDomains`   Keep both domains and subdomains in output (this catches both `example.com` and `www.example.com`)

  - `-r`, `--resolve`   Only get items that resolve (using local DNS settings)

#### Examples

Read a file on disk

```bash
‚ùØ subs test.txt
subdomain1.example.com
subdomain2.example.com
subdomain3.example.com
subdomain4.example.com
...
```

Read all files in a directory

```bash
‚ùØ for file in *; subs "$file"
www.gnu.org
google.golang.org
subdomain1.example.com
...
```

Generate permutations from a wordlist, resolve them and remove duplicates on the way.

```bash
‚ùØ wget "https://wordlists-cdn.assetnote.io/data/manual/best-dns-wordlist.txt" -O
best-dns-wordlist.txt        100% [===================================>]  76.65M  2.28MB/s    eta 24s    

‚ùØ awk '{print}' best-dns-wordlist.txt | xargs -n1 | while read line; do echo $line; done | xargs -n1 -I{} bash -c 'for i in $(cat best-dns-wordlist.txt); do for j in $(cat best-dns-wordlist.txt); do if [ "$i" != "$j" ]; then echo "$i.$j"; fi; done; done' >> permutations.txt

# This takes a long, long time.

‚ùØ subs permutations.txt -r -p >> output.txt

# This takes even more time.

{"subdomain":"www.ci.dev","domain":"ci.dev"}
{"subdomain":"www.api.app","domain":"api.app"}
{"subdomain":"www.www.furniture","domain":"www.furniture"}
{"subdomain":"www.web.dev","domain":"web.dev"}
{"subdomain":"www.jira.dev","domain":"jira.dev"}

...
```

Continuously scan certificates on crt.sh for alive subdomains with autoincremented id

```bash
‚ùØ id=129341; while true; do wget "https://crt.sh/?q=$id" -O .temp && subs .temp -r -p >> output.txt && rm .temp; id=$((id + 1)); done
{"subdomain":"crt.sh","domain":"crt.sh"}
{"subdomain":"fonts.googleapis.com","domain":"googleapis.com"}
{"subdomain":"ct.googleapis.com","domain":"googleapis.com"}
{"subdomain":"plausible.ct.nordu.net","domain":"nordu.net"}
```
